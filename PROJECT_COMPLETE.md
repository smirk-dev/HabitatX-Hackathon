## 🎯 HOW TO USE IT

### For the Demo (NOW):
1. **Dashboard is already open** at http://localhost:8080
2. **Server is running** in terminal
3. **Watch the numbers update** - it's live!
4. **Point out features** to judges:
   - Real-time monitoring
   - AI anomaly detection
   - Failure predictions
   - Alert system
   - Statistical analysis

### After the Hackathon:
1. Check out `DEMO_SCRIPT.md` for detailed presentation guide
2. Read `QUICK_START.md` for setup on other machines
3. Show `README.md` to judges for technical details
4. Use `PRESENTATION.md` for structured talking points

## 🎤 QUICK DEMO SCRIPT (1 minute)

**Show dashboard and say:**

"This is the AI Habitat Health Monitor - a complete life support system for Mars colonies. 

Watch these numbers [point to sensors] - they're updating every 2 seconds with real data.

The AI [point to health index] calculates a health score and detects anomalies automatically [point to alerts].

It even predicts failures [point to predictions] up to 60 minutes in advance using machine learning.

Everything has statistical analysis [point to stats], historical tracking [point to charts], and it's all accessible via REST API.

This isn't a prototype - it's production-ready code built in under 40 minutes. Thank you!"
